    <h1>I am Kristian</h1>
    <article>Hello! I'm Kristian Dotson and I am a student at CodeCrew. I'm an aspiring Software Developer. I have some experience dealing with coding because of some of the courses I took throughout Highschool. I'm great at collaborating with other people and being able to learn from people that I'm working with. I would love to learn from experienced software developers and be able to add more onto my skillset. I have job experience dealing with a summer work program and having experience with making my own website with a class mate. Dealt with team building workshops and having to be able to work with people from all different backgrounds.
